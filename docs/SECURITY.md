# Security Policy

The 202ecommerce team and community take security bugs in our PrestaShop modules seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

## Supported Versions

Security updates will typically only be applied to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to tech@202-ecommerce.com, which will go to security team members.
The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. 
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

 - Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
 - Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
 - Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.


## Disclosure Policy

In general, public disclosure are made after the issue has been fully identified and a patch is ready to be released.
